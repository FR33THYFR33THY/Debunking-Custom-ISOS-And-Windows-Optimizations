# Debunking-ISOS-&-Windows-Optimizations

**W10 VS W11 VS ADMIN ACCOUNT?**
- This has already been debunked, no difference <br>
- https://github.com/fr33thytweaks/W10-W11-Admin-Benchmarks <br>
- Because of this, W11 has been chosen for most custom ISO'S tested <br>

Let's clear up the confusion around the 24H2 update: there is no performance difference when running games or benchmarks on Windows 10 or Windows 11/Admin or Local Account across all versions, as long as you're running the game as an administrator.

The explanations from YouTubers on this topic have become muddled and misleading. People are mistakenly thinking that 24H2 is some kind of golden performance fix, but that's simply not the case.
Yes, some games do seem to run better when launched as an administrator. The 24H2 update and future Windows plans aim to address this, so games won’t need to be run as admin to achieve optimal performance.
Due to this stock W10Stock, W11Stock, W10Server and W11Server had UAC disabled during tests to rule out any issues.

Testing LTSC is unnecessary since it's essentially a branch of standard Windows builds with some bloat removed and only security updates. <br>

**CONSIDER BENCHMARK VARIATION**

If you're analyzing these benchmarks to choose the best ISO, STOP! <br>
The differences are simply due to variations in benchmark runs.

- Blue = Average FPS
- Dark Grey = 1% low FPS
- Light Grey = 0.1% low FPS
- Left MS = Throughput End To End System Latency

**CONCLUSION**

When considering benchmark variations, it's clear that custom ISOs are obsolete. <br>

Most Windows optimizations offer little to no performance gains. The exception lies with older low-end hardware, where minimal background processes and disabling Windows Defender can provide noticeable improvements due to cpu usage. 
This likely explains the benchmark differences often seen when people promote custom ISOs—most of the time, these tests are usually conducted on systems with a few generations old, low-end CPUs.<br>

Why risk installing a custom ISO that could contain malware, spyware, bad optimizations, keyloggers, or even bitcoin miners?
A vanilla Windows installation is sufficient, safe and you can achieve optimizations using simple scripts instead (if needed at all). <br>

There's one exception I can't explain: Windows 11 2025 Server and Windows 10 2022 Server perform significantly better when CPU-bound in the 1080p Call of Duty: MW2 2022 benchmark.
After reinstalling and retesting Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows 11 2025 Server, and Windows 10 2022 Server, and running the MW2 benchmark as well as testing in a real match, I reached the same conclusion.
For some reason, the server versions perform better when CPU-bound in MW2. This seems unexplainable from my perspective, likely due to poor engine optimization.
Side note, MW2 performed poorly on Windows 10 2022 Server unless chipset drivers were installed, benchmarks were identical on the other windows builds with or without chipset drivers.

**WHAT ABOUT LATENCYMON BENCHMARKS?**

https://www.resplendence.com/latencymon <br>
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/ <br> <br>
LatencyMon and Xperf are only useful for diagnosing driver issues or audio dropouts related to drivers. <br>
Their purpose has been misunderstood in tweaking communities, with many mistakenly believing they measure real end-to-end latency. <br> <br>
In reality, driver latency is just a minor part of the overall latency chain, so obsessing over LatencyMon or Xperf results is a waste of time. <br>
https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/geforce/guides/system-latency-optimization-guide/

Real throughput latency is what truly matters and should be the focus when comparing optimizations. <br>
NVIDIA has made it easy to measure this without the need for special tools in FrameView or the GeForce overlay.<br>

**WHAT REALLY MATTERS THEN?**

It all boils down to the basics. Here’s my take on what truly matters when optimizing for more frames and lower latency.
I'm planning to demonstrate scaling with these factors in future videos, but for now, here are my thoughts. <br>

- Fastest gaming CPU to spit out frames (keep up with the GPU)
- Fastest gaming GPU to spit out frames (keep up with the CPU, resolution and game settings) (help maintain lower GPU usage)
- Ram optimizations (decent ram kit, using xmp,docp or expo) (speed up the CPU)
- Fastest high refresh rate monitor (includes lower res)
- Oled instead of VA, IPS and TN
- Lowest latency mouse
- Lowest latency keyboard
- Overclocking Ram, CPU and GPU to make your components run faster
- Stability, an unstable system will cause framerate and latency issues
- Good/performance graphic driver settings
- Good/Low game config and in game settings (to achieve higher fps and lower gpu usage)
- Flip model in game, using hardware indepenant flip or legacy flip
- Lowering resolution, dlss or fsr techniques (to achieve higher fps and lower gpu usage)
- Nvidia reflex on + boost, will drastically lower your latency in a gpu bound situation
- As discussed here, the conclusion is that Defender and background bloat primarily impact low-end CPUs and systems the most.
- Background programs running that use CPU, GPU usage
